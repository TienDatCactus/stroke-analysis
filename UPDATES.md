# Updates to Stroke Analysis App

## Fixed Issues (May 25, 2025)

The following issues have been resolved in the latest update:

### 1. Fixed pandas FutureWarning in data processing

- Added warning suppression for `FutureWarning` from pandas when using `replace()` function
- Now uses proper warning handling to avoid distracting warnings during prediction

### 2. Fixed scikit-learn version inconsistency warning

- Added proper warning suppression for model loading
- Improved error handling when loading the model
- The model still works correctly but should be retrained with the current version of scikit-learn in the future

### 3. Fixed Python module import issues

- Renamed the predict module to have the proper .py extension
- Added better error handling for file loading
- Fixed dynamic module imports in run_prediction.py

### 4. Improved error handling

- Added more robust error handling throughout the prediction code
- Better logging of errors and debugging information
- Fixed issues with nested exception handling

### 5. Added model retraining capability

- Added `retrain_model.py` script to retrain the model with the latest scikit-learn version
- This can eliminate version warnings permanently by creating an updated model file

## Compatibility Notes

- The app now works with Python 3.13 using requirements.txt dependencies
- The model was trained with an older version of scikit-learn but works fine with current version
- For optimal performance, use `retrain_model.py` to create an updated model with your current scikit-learn version

## Future Improvements

- Improve the API response format to include more detailed prediction statistics
- Add more unit tests for the prediction module
- Consider adding a confidence score for each prediction

## How to Retrain the Model

To retrain the model with your current scikit-learn version:

```bash
python retrain_model.py --input path/to/training_data.xlsx --output src/middleware/random_forest_model.pkl
```

This will create a new model file compatible with your current scikit-learn installation.
